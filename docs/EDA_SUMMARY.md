# EDA Summary - Suicide Ideation Detection

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Analyst:** Automated EDA from Colab

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Total samples:** 232,074
- **Clean samples:** 232,074 (no data loss!)
- **Source:** Social media text (Reddit/Twitter)
- **Task:** Binary classification (suicide vs non-suicide)

---

## ✅ Class Distribution - PERFECTLY BALANCED!

| Class | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Suicide | 116,037 | 50.0% |
| Non-suicide | 116,037 | 50.0% |

**Imbalance Ratio:** 1.0 (perfectly balanced)

### 👉 **Decision: NO class weights needed!**
- Standard cross-entropy loss will work fine
- No need for focal loss or oversampling
- This simplifies training significantly

---

## 📏 Text Length Statistics

### Word Count:
- **Mean:** 131.9 words
- **Median:** 60.0 words
- Distribution is **right-skewed** (most posts are short, some are very long)

### Token Coverage:
- **≤ 128 tokens:** 63.7% (147,876 samples)
- **≤ 256 tokens:** 80.7% (187,371 samples) ← **Selected**
- **≤ 512 tokens:** Higher, but 4x slower training

---

## 🎯 Key Decisions for Training

### 1. **max_seq_length = 256**
**Rationale:**
- 80.7% coverage is good (industry standard: 75-85%)
- 2x faster than 512 tokens
- Only 19.3% get truncated (acceptable trade-off)
- Most important info in social media posts is at the beginning

### 2. **NO class weights**
**Rationale:**
- Perfect 50/50 balance
- Standard cross-entropy loss is sufficient
- Simpler training, easier to debug

### 3. **Data quality: Excellent**
- No missing values after cleaning
- All text fields valid
- Class labels consistent

## 📈 Token Distribution Insights

Looking at the token count histogram:
- **Peak at 0-50 tokens:** Most posts are very short
- **Long tail to 1000+ tokens:** Some posts are essays
- **Median at 60 words ≈ 78 tokens:** Half of data is very compact

### What this means:
- Models will see mostly short texts during training
- Truncation at 256 tokens won't hurt much
- The few very long posts (outliers) won't dominate training

---

## 🔍 Text Length by Class

Both classes have similar token distributions:
- No significant difference in post length between suicide/non-suicide
- Models can't just rely on "length" as a feature
- Must learn semantic/linguistic patterns

---

## ✅ Final Configuration

```yaml
preprocessing:
  max_seq_length: 256
  padding: true
  truncation: true

class_weights:
  enabled: false  # Perfectly balanced dataset

training:
  per_device_train_batch_size: 16  # Can increase to 32 on good GPU
  num_train_epochs: 3
  learning_rate: 2e-5
```
