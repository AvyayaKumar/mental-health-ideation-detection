# Realistic Fast-Track Plan: 4-5 Weeks

## Gemini's Reality Check: Key Insights

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ Running 4-6 parallel Colab sessions (GPU limits will block you)
- ❌ 14-day timeline (no time for debugging, analysis, or quality)
- ❌ Assuming everything works perfectly first time
- ❌ 2 days for error analysis + SHAP (computationally intensive)
- ❌ Skipping hyperparameter validation

**What's Realistic:**
- ✅ 2-3 parallel Colab sessions max (maybe)
- ✅ 4-5 week timeline with focused scope
- ✅ Buffer time for debugging and iteration
- ✅ Proper error analysis (takes time)
- ✅ Quality over speed

---

## REALISTIC TIMELINE: 4-5 Weeks (28-35 Days)

**Philosophy:** Move fast, but maintain research quality

**Colab Strategy:** 2 parallel sessions max + sequential training when needed

**Work Pace:** 6-8 hours/day, sustainable pace

---

### Week 1: Foundation (Days 1-7)

#### Days 1-2: Data Understanding & Setup
**Morning (3 hours):**
- EDA in Colab
- Check class distribution (calculate class weights if imbalanced)
- Analyze text length distribution
- **Decision points:**
  - Max sequence length (likely 128 or 256)
  - Need for class balancing?

**Afternoon (3 hours):**
- Create 80/10/10 stratified split
- Verify stratification worked
- Save indices to Google Drive
- Document split statistics

**Evening (2 hours):**
- Set up wandb account
- Create project structure in Drive
- Upload dataset and splits

**Deliverable:** Data ready, splits verified, wandb configured

---

#### Days 3-4: Infrastructure + Baseline
**Day 3 (6 hours):**
- Create minimal config system (base_config.yaml + model configs)
- Build `dataset.py` with tokenization caching
- Build `metrics.py` with all evaluation functions
- Build `utils.py` for helpers

**Don't overthink:** Simple, working code is enough. You can refactor later.

**Day 4 (4 hours):**
- Implement TF-IDF + LogReg baseline
- Train and evaluate
- Log to wandb
- **Expected F1: 0.75-0.85**

**Why this matters:** If transformers can't beat this, you have a bug in your pipeline.

**Deliverable:** Working baseline, validated pipeline

---

#### Days 5-7: First Transformer Models
**Strategy:** Run 2 sessions in parallel (realistic limit)

**Session 1:** DistilBERT
**Session 2:** BERT-base

Each with seed=42, standard config:
```yaml
learning_rate: 2e-5
batch_size: 16 (or 32 if GPU allows)
epochs: 3
max_seq_length: 128
```

**Training time:** 5-8 hours per model (conservative estimate)

**Day 5:** Start both, monitor via wandb
**Day 6:** Both complete, analyze results
**Day 7:** If results look good, start seeds 123, 456 for whichever performed better

**Deliverable:** 2-4 models trained, initial comparison

**Reality check:** If either model fails or crashes, you have time to debug.

---

### Week 2: Core Model Comparison (Days 8-14)

#### Days 8-10: Train RoBERTa + ELECTRA
**Why these?** Based on literature and Gemini's recommendation, these are strong performers.

**Parallel approach:**
- **Session 1:** RoBERTa seed 42
- **Session 2:** ELECTRA seed 42

**Sequential if parallel fails:**
Train one after the other.

**Estimated time:** 2-3 days (including potential reruns)

**Deliverable:** 4 models with seed 42 complete

---

#### Days 11-12: Multiple Seeds for Top 2 Models
Based on Days 8-10 results, identify top 2 performers.

**Realistic approach:**
- Run seed 123 for Model A
- Run seed 456 for Model A
- Run seed 123 for Model B
- Run seed 456 for Model B

**Can do 2 at a time if lucky, otherwise sequential**

**Estimated time:** 2 days

**Deliverable:** Top 2 models with 3 seeds each = 6 runs total

---

#### Days 13-14: Analysis & Decision Point
**Analyze all results:**
- Create comparison table (mean ± std)
- Identify best model
- Check if F1 > 0.88 and FNR < 7%

**Decision:**
- **If results are good:** Proceed to error analysis
- **If results are mediocre:** Spend Week 3 on hyperparameter tuning
- **If results are bad:** Debug your pipeline (data leakage? wrong labels?)

**Buffer day:** Use Day 14 to catch up on any failed runs or debugging

---

### Week 3: Refinement (Days 15-21)

#### Option A: Results Already Good (F1 > 0.90)
**Skip to error analysis and ensemble**

#### Option B: Results Need Improvement (F1 < 0.90)
**Days 15-18: Focused Hyperparameter Search**

For your single best model, test these configs:
```python
configs = [
    {'lr': 1e-5, 'epochs': 4, 'batch': 16},
    {'lr': 3e-5, 'epochs': 3, 'batch': 32},
    {'lr': 2e-5, 'epochs': 4, 'batch': 16, 'warmup': 0.1},
    {'lr': 2e-5, 'epochs': 3, 'batch': 16, 'max_len': 256},
]
```

**Run 2 at a time if possible**

**Expected gain:** +0.02-0.05 F1

---

#### Days 19-20: Ensemble Experiments
**Only if you have multiple strong models**

Test simple approaches:
1. Soft voting (average probabilities)
2. Weighted average (weight by validation F1)

**Expected time:** 4-6 hours total

**Skip if:** Best individual model already excellent

---

#### Day 21: Week 3 Wrap-up
- Finalize best model/ensemble
- Re-run on test set with 3 seeds if needed
- Document final configuration

---

### Week 4: Analysis & Testing (Days 22-28)

#### Days 22-24: Error Analysis
**Quantitative (Day 22):**
- Generate confusion matrices for top models
- Bucket errors:
  - False Negatives (high confidence)
  - False Negatives (low confidence)
  - False Positives (high confidence)
  - False Positives (low confidence)

**Qualitative (Day 23):**
- Sample 50-100 False Negatives
- Manual review: identify patterns
- Look for: passive voice, conditionals, sarcasm, reported speech
- Document 3-5 recurring themes

**Interpretability (Day 24):**
- Select 10-15 representative FN examples
- Run SHAP on best model
- Generate visualizations
- Write up findings (1-2 pages)

**Deliverable:** Error analysis report with concrete insights

---

#### Days 25-26: Statistical Validation
**Tests to run:**
- McNemar's test: best model vs baseline
- Paired t-test: compare top models (if using multiple seeds)
- Confidence intervals for F1, FNR

**Visualizations:**
- Bar charts (accuracy, F1, precision, recall, FNR)
- Confusion matrices
- Precision-recall curves
- Model comparison table

**Deliverable:** All statistical tests complete, all figures generated

---

#### Days 27-28: Documentation & Buffer
**Day 27:**
- Compile all results into master CSV
- Verify all checkpoints are saved
- Document all configurations used
- Create reproducibility checklist

**Day 28:**
- **Buffer day for any remaining tasks**

**Publication-ready?** **YES** - this is a solid empirical study

---

### What You CANNOT Accomplish in 4-5 Weeks:

- ❌ Training 6+ models with extensive tuning
- ❌ 5-fold cross-validation
- ❌ Deep linguistic analysis (corpus linguistics level)
- ❌ Novel model architectures
- ❌ Extensive data augmentation experiments
- ❌ Multiple ensemble approaches comparison
- ❌ Demographic bias analysis (unless data exists)
- ❌ Polished, publication-ready paper (needs more iteration)

## Colab Pro Resource Strategy

### Realistic Parallel Execution:
**Maximum:** 2 active GPU sessions simultaneously
**Safe bet:** 1-2 sessions

**How to maximize:**
1. Train models overnight (Colab Pro = 24hr sessions)
2. Use one session for long training, another for shorter tasks
3. If you get locked out of GPUs, fall back to sequential

### Training Time Estimates (Conservative):
- DistilBERT: 4-6 hours
- BERT-base: 6-8 hours
- RoBERTa-base: 6-8 hours
- ELECTRA-base: 5-7 hours
- XLNet-base: 8-10 hours (skip if time-constrained)

**Total sequential time:** ~35-45 hours of GPU time
**With 2 parallel sessions:** ~20-25 hours wall time
**Across 4 weeks:** Very achievable

---

## Week-by-Week Milestones

| Week | Key Milestone | Success Criteria |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| 1 | Baseline + 2 models trained | F1 > baseline, wandb logging works |
| 2 | 4 models compared, top 2 with 3 seeds | Clear ranking, mean±std calculated |
| 3 | Refinement complete | Best model F1 > 0.88, FNR < 7% |
| 4 | Analysis done | Error patterns identified, stats tests complete |
| 5 | Write-up (optional) | Paper draft or comprehensive report |

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Expected Problems & Solutions:

**Problem:** Colab disconnects during training
**Solution:**
- Save checkpoints every 500 steps to Drive
- Use Colab Pro's 24hr sessions (set timer to reconnect)
- Resume from checkpoint if crash occurs

**Problem:** GPU unavailable / stuck on CPU
**Solution:**
- Wait a few hours, try again
- Train smaller model (DistilBERT) on CPU as fallback
- Use multiple Colab accounts if desperate (not recommended)

**Problem:** Model performance worse than baseline
**Solution:**
- Check for data leakage (test set contamination)
- Verify labels are correct
- Try class weights / focal loss
- Increase epochs to 4-5

**Problem:** Can't run multiple sessions in parallel
**Solution:**
- Fall back to sequential training
- Add 1 week to timeline
- Prioritize top 3 models only

---

## Time Investment Breakdown

**Total hours:** ~120-160 hours over 4-5 weeks

| Phase | Hours | Intensity |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Week 1: Setup + Baseline | 25-30h | Medium |
| Week 2: Model Training | 30-40h | High (monitoring) |
| Week 3: Refinement | 25-30h | Medium |
| Week 4: Analysis | 30-40h | High (deep work) |
| Week 5: Write-up (optional) | 30-40h | Medium |

**Daily average:** 4-6 hours (sustainable)
**Peak days:** 8-10 hours (training launch days)

---

## Quality vs Speed Trade-offs

### What You Keep (Research Integrity):
- ✅ Multiple models comparison
- ✅ Multiple seeds (mean ± std)
- ✅ Proper train/val/test split
- ✅ Statistical significance testing
- ✅ Error analysis with domain insights
- ✅ Reproducible methodology

### What You Sacrifice (Nice-to-Haves):
- ⚠️ Exhaustive hyperparameter search (focused search only)
- ⚠️ 6+ model architectures (limit to 4-5)
- ⚠️ Cross-validation (single split is acceptable)
- ⚠️ Deep linguistic analysis (surface patterns only)
- ⚠️ Perfect code organization (good enough is fine)
- ⚠️ Polished paper (draft quality acceptable)

---

## Final Recommendation

**Choose: 5-week timeline**

**Week 1-2:** Training (get all models done)
**Week 3:** Refinement (tune best models)
**Week 4:** Analysis (deep dive into results)
**Week 5:** Buffer + write-up

**Why 5 weeks?**
1. Leaves room for debugging (you WILL hit bugs)
2. Allows proper error analysis (most valuable part)
3. Sustainable work pace (avoid burnout)
4. Maintains research quality
5. Still much faster than 7-12 weeks

**Can you finish in 4 weeks?** Yes, if:
- Everything works first time
- You skip hyperparameter tuning
- You accept minimal error analysis
- You're okay with a results summary (not full paper)

**Bottom line:**
- **Fastest credible timeline:** 4 weeks
- **Recommended timeline:** 5 weeks
- **Safe timeline:** 6 weeks

All are significantly faster than 7-12 weeks, but maintain quality.
